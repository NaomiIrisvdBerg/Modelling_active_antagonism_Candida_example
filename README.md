In this work, I present a conceptual framework for incorporating different modes of active antagonism into mass-balanced, population-level models to account for the dynamic impact of antimicrobial compounds on community dynamics. By reverse-engineering a known case of active antagonism between Candida and Lactobacillus (as reported by Vazquez-Munoz et al., 2022), I aim to demonstrate how a fusion of phenomenological and mechanistic modelling can improve replication of antagonism-mediated emergent properties in microbial ecosystems. 
This approach represents a concept towards more accurate, multi-scale models, combining molecular-level data with population dynamics in an age of rapidly expanding genomic information and functional annotations.
